### What?
Simple tool for saving bookmarks for web pages in a browser independent format, which promotes simplicity over intergration.

### Why?
Once upon a time [Delicious](http://delicious.com) used to do quite a good job of keeping track of your bookmarks in a satisfactory manner. Time changes, but the needs are still present.

### How?
Trying to keep things as simple as possible, focusing on core features such as _save_ and _search_. While automatic syncing is usually considered an important feature of a bookmark keeper, I recommend [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) for that.
